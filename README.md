About Letter Drop (jQuery)
===========

jQuery plugin for a CSS based letter drop animation effect. The plugin takes the text string within the defined element & splits each letter out adding a random delay to each from 1.0 to 1.9 secs before dropping & rotating the letters down like droplets of rain.

Features
===========
* Lightweight - weighing in at 1.25kb (uncompressed), 603 bytes (minified) & 375 bytes (gzipped)
* Unobtrusive - if letter drop conflicts with any of your existing code or plugins I will personally buy you a beer!
* Chains - compliments core & UI jQuery functions when writing in a chain ( ... .show().letterDrop().fadeOut(6000) )
* Configurable - Letter Drop's custom rain animation can be fully manipulated, altered or replaced completely in the letter_drop.css file (bundled)

Dependancies
===========
1. jQuery 2.x or higher
2. letter_drop.css (bundled)

Usage
===========
$( 'selector' ).letterDrop();
